‚ùì What is the significance of the JOIN operation, and how does it work in PostgreSQL?

**Answer:**  
JOIN is used to combine data from two tables based on a related column between them.
Joining multiple tables helps reduce data duplication and allows retrieving related information efficiently.
For JOIN to work, both tables must have a linking field (a common column).
There are several types of JOINs, such as:
INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, CROSSJOIN.
